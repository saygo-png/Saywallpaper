= Saywallpaper

Minimalist Wayland wallpaper daemon in Haskell without libwayland. It allows displaying any binary file because it's fun.
It tells Wayland to interpret the binary file as Wayland's "argb8888" format.

== Usage

You can use imagemagick to convert most images into this format.

`magick wallpaper.png -depth 8 bgra:wallpaper.raw`

Provide the image to Saywallpaper using the `-i` flag.

`saywallpaper -i wallpaper.raw`

The image is assumed to be width 1920, height 1080 by default.

== Configuration

This program is configured in source code.
Notably it has a hardcoded image resolution of 1920x1080.
Options you might want to change are in `Config.hs`

== Notes

I'm not planning to make this project fully featured. For example I'm not gonna deal with fractional scaling.
If you need that, use swaybg instead.

Only tested on Linux (NixOS), but I think it *should* work on all POSIX platforms.

== Building

Build with Nix flakes: `nix build`

Build using Cabal: `cabal build`
